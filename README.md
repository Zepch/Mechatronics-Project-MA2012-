# Mechatronics-Project-MA2012-
Master-Slave Interface using I2C Protocol.
This was a group project for MA2012 Mechatronics System Interfacing. Our group won 2nd place from the entire AY2022/2023 Mechanical Engineering (Robotics Stream) Cohort.

The source code (C++) provided is to drive several actuators and sensors, as well as a LCD-Keypad Interface (for Password Lock) and Voltage Control Input Device paired with ADC (for Safe-like locks). The overall scheme (or project lore) is to safeguard a gem inside an ancient pyramid filled with traps. There are 2 levels in the pyramid filled with traps and riddles that the player has to complete to finally reach the top of the pyramid where the gem lies.
